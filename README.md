## My process

To build this QR component, I started by writing all of the HTML for the content that needed to be displayed on the webpage. This included any images, titles, paragraphs, and any containers that I would need for the placement of the QR component card.

Before jumping to the CSS, I analyzed the figma design and took notes of the size of the elements, as well as any box-shadows, padding, margins, and text size.

After making notes of these details, I started writing the CSS for QR component to style it according to the figma design with all of the exact font-sizes, box-shadow properties, and overall sizing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the biggest things I learned was how to take a design from an application (in this case Figma) and implement it with the correct text/font specifications, padding, etc.

### Continued development

In the future, when I start creating more complicated websites, I would like to focus more on accessibility. I would also like to improve on my HTML. I want to write clean HTML code that does not have any "useless" tags that could be removed.

As the challenges I work on get harder, I would also like to work on making the elements on my website responsive.
